Scripts coordinating the use of PyCCD on Google Earth Engine data. This repository is not officially associated with Google nor the USGS. 

# PyCCD
[PyCCD](https://github.com/USGS-EROS/lcmap-pyccd) is the USGS Python implementation of the change detection portion of the [CCDC](https://github.com/USGS-EROS/matlab-ccdc) algorithm. 

# Google Earth Engine
[Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) is a project that combines multi-source remote sensing data with high-performance cloud computing for global analysis. Google Earth Engine has a [Python API](https://github.com/google/earthengine-api) to interact with the data catelog. 
# The repository
The purpose of this repository is for providing basic scripts to utilize the PyCCD algorithm with data stored on the Earth Engine.
